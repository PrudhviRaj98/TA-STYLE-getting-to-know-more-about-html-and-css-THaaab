                     on a self-contained incident or series of 
                     linked incidents, with the intent of evoking a 
                     single effect or mood. The short story is one of 
                     the oldest types of literature and has existed in
                      the form of legends, mythic tales, folk tales,
                      fairy tales, fables and anecdotes in various 
                      ancient communities across the world. The 
                      modern short story developed in the early 
                      19th century.
