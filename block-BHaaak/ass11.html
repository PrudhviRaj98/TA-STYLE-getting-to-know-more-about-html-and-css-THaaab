        <p>The short story is a crafted form in its own right. 
            Short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other
            dynamic components as in a novel, but typically to a
            lesser degree. While the short story is largely 
            distinct from the novel or novella/short novel, 
            authors generally draw from a common pool of literary
            techniques.
        </p>Determining what exactly separates a short story from 
        longer fictional formats is problematic. A  classic definiti
        on of a short story is that one should be able to read it 
        in one sitting, a point most notably made in Edgar Allan
         Poe's essay "The Philosophy of Composition" (1846).[1] 
         According to William Faulkner, a short story is character 
         driven and a writer's job is to "...trot along behind him 
         with a paper and pencil trying to keep up long enough to 
         put down what he says and does.

        <h3>Para 1 To Introduction</h3>
        <p>short stories] seem to answer something very deep in our 
            nature as if, for the duration of its telling, something
            special has been created, some essence of our experience
            extrapolated, some temporary sense has been made of our
            common, turbulent journey towards the grave and
            oblivion
        </p>
        <h3>Paragraph 2 Travel</h3>

            world "travels" saying his dream is to become a writer. 
            After suffering writer's block and thinking that Darcy

        <p>In terms of length, word count is typically anywhere from 
            1,000 to 4,000 for short stories, however some have 15,000
            e still classed as short stories. Stories of fewer than 
            1,000 words are sometimes referred to as "short short stories",
             or "flash fiction".[5]
